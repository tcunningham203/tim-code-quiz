A timed quiz about Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores. 



## Credits
I used the mini project from "04-Web-Apis" to help understand the local storage.

I used help from this website to figure out how to do the quiz. However, their quiz was pretty different from what the challenge called for, so I had to change a lot. I basically just kept the way they had all the questions as 1 variable but a lot of other stuff was changed.
